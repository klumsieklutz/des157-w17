      <h2>History of Hmong Fashion</h2>
      <p>
      The Hmong people is an ethnic minority in various parts of the world, such as East Asia, Southeast Asia, North America, South America, Europe, and Australia. Due to oppressions and imperial subjugations, there were countless resistances and exoduses that contributed in the widespread resettlement. Although Hmong has adapted their own autonomous identity around the world, Hmong clothing is a cultural marker of the Hmong identity that continues to unify the people.

Over 130,000 Hmong war-torn refugees resettled in the United States after the end of Vietnam War in 1975 under the Indochina Migration and Refugee Act (Vang 2010, 1). Hmong refugees incrementally resettled well into 1980’s, making United States their permanent home. By the end of 1980’s (Miyares), the Hmong was most populous in Central Valley of California, particularly Merced and Sacramento, and Twin Cities of Minnesota (1998, 21-50; Vang 2010, 55). To deal with a new population in the American society, the Refugee Act of 1980 was established to set uniform settlement goals and procedures and financial plans. Public and private agencies were required to provide training programs and ESL education for a “rapid assimilation” and self-sufficiency among refugees (Miyares 1998, 12). Economic pressures and desire for familial support led to secondary migration into Fresno. Even with political pressure to assimilate in the new world, Hmong mothers continue to teach their daughters the traditional arts of needlework and encourage them to make their own Hmong outfits for the annual Hmong New Year festivals. Despite acquiring minimal or no formal education, Hmong women were self-sufficient in providing an income through the production and commercialization of Hmong clothes. This phenomena is ultimately important in that Hmong clothes passed on to younger generations or other family members are important symbolic pieces of the Hmong culture (Hales 2003, 51).

Hmong fashion represents the ethnic identity, origin of region, history, and dialect spoken. Hales depicts that Hmong fashion businesses started informally, independently and relatively small, receiving products from relatives overseas for the Hmong consumers in the states. Statistic shows that there had been a large increase of Hmong women securing more sales occupations in 2000 and 2010 compared to 1990 (Vang 2012, 5).
